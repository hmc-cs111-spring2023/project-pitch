# Project Pitch

In this assignment, you will refine the idea for your project. In contrast to the
previous projects ideas you described, the project you describe in this
assignment should be the one you plan to do. This is your chance to lay out some
of your initial ideas, based on the feedback and thoughts you've had since the
previous project ideas.

Additionally, you will create a "contract" for your work on the project, which describes
what you want to get out of the project and how you want to be assessed on the project.

## Contract

In `contract.md`, respond thoughtfully to the questions. Your responses will help set up
your goals for the project and guide your assessment. Each response should be at least 2-3
well-written paragraphs (with the exception of the "Teamwork" section, if you are not
working with anyone else).

One of the questions asks you about what an "A" is for the project. When answering this
question, keep in mind that a "B" means that you complete all the weekly milestones and
critiques and a "B+" means that the project is additionally well-packaged for someone else
to understand (and potentially use) it.

## Pitch

The file `project.md` provides a place for you to describe your proposed project. Because
you are describing only one project this week, be sure to take extra time to describe it
well! Your goal should be to specify your current thoughts about the project, your current
unknowns, and your sense of how suitable the project is for this course. For most
questions, 1-2 well-written paragraphs should suffice. Provide enough detail so that I and
others in the class can give you helpful feedback. Aim for clarity; if you're not certain
yet about something, say so!

Note that the questions in `project.md` are the same ones from HW 3. You can copy / paste
some of your material from a project idea, if there's some overlap. But be sure to also
address the comments of anyone else (e.g., classmates, me etc.), which may have come up in
the past few weeks.

**Additionally, be prepared to talk about your project in class on Monday,
March 27.** There's nothing extra to prepare for this discussion (other than
doing this assignment); but be prepared to discuss. The goal for that class
will be to feel confident about your project, thanks to the work you've done
for this assignment and the feedback you will get in class.

**Note:** If you plan to work with someone on the project, that's great! For this
assignment, though, each of you should write up your own, independent pitch and contract.
Please let me know, in the project description, if you'd like to work with someone else on
the project.

## Grading

Good responses will:

+ fully respond to every prompt in the starter files, _and_
+ be well-written and easy to read, i.e., clear yet concise conveying a well-formed idea,
  _and_
+ where appropriate, support your thoughts with references to material from class, from
the domain of your project, or from other solutions in the same domain.

Great responses (i.e., responses that receive a 4) will additionally:

+ be particularly insightful about the needs of the user and about the suitability of the
idea as a CS 111 project ("insightful" means that you've clearly articulated all the
angles, the benefits and drawbacks, risks, etc.),
+ be particularly detailed about how you plan to manage your time and provide good
  feedback to other people in the class,
+ be particularly clear about the challenges of the project and your current open
questions about the project,
+ provide some initial, well-reasoned speculation about how the implementation will
proceed, including: what you plan to work on first, whether the project might work best as
an internal or external language, candidates for potential host languages, etc.

## Critiques

After the submission deadline, I will assign critique teams.

You will meet in the teams during Monday's class, where you will generate some material
for your first critique. The critique will then be due Tuesday night.

Here are some suggestions for critiques:

+ What do you like about their idea?
+ Was there a need that was similar to one you thought of? If so, how are
your thoughts about the problems similar to and different from your partners?
+ Do you know anything about this domain? Do you know of existing DSLs that
they didn't mention or do you have some expertise thinking about or writing
programs for this domain? How might your experience augment your partner's
thoughts on the domain?
+ Answer the questions about suitability, scope, etc. of the project.
+ What's not clear about the project?

## Tasks

+ [ ] Write responses in the file `pitch.md`.
+ [ ] Write responses in the file `contract.md`.
+ [ ] Submit your work (by pushing it to GitHub and submitting it on Gradescope)
+ [ ] Comment on your critique partners' work.
